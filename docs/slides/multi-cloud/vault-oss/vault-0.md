# Lab Environment & Conduct
* This workshop uses [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com) for hands-on labs.
* Instruqt labs are run in "tracks" that are divided into "challenges".
* The lab environment will still be available after this workshop and you can always re-attempt them.
* We will take a pause at the end of every chapter for a short Q&A.
* We will use an online poll to keep track of our progress.
